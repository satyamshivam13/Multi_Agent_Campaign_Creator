"""
LangGraph orchestration for the campaign pipeline.

This module wraps the existing CrewAI agents in a LangGraph state machine.
The division of labour mirrors how production agentic systems are built:

    * **LangGraph** owns the *control flow* — which agent runs next, how state
      is threaded between stages, and where the pipeline halts on failure.
    * **CrewAI** owns the *execution* — each node runs a single CrewAI ``Agent``
      inside a one-task ``Crew`` and returns its output as text.

Unlike ``CampaignCrew`` (which hands the whole pipeline to ``Crew.kickoff()``
and lets CrewAI sequence the tasks internally), here each stage is an explicit
graph node. Upstream outputs are injected into the next node's task description,
so the agents stay decoupled and the routing is visible and testable.
